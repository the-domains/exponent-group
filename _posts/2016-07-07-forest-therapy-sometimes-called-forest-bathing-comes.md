  "Forest
   therapy," sometimes called "forest bathing," comes from Japan, where 
  researchers are studying the physiological impact of spending time in 
  the woods. So far, research has indicated that it does have measurable 
  health benefits - it can lower levels of salivary cortisol, the hormone 
  that rises when we're under stress. It can also lower blood pressure and
   pulse rate and trigger a dramatic increase in the activity of natural 
  killer (NK) cells, which are produced by the immune system to ward off 
  infection and fight cancer. Japanese researchers have reported that 
  spending three days in the forest increases NK activity by 50 percent, a
   beneficial effect that can last up to one month.
