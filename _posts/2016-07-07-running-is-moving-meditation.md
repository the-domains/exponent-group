## Running Is Moving Meditation

Sure, there's the occasional day where I'm dying to run, where I've been waiting all day for the moment when I can prepare with my own ritual: adorn myself in essential garments (shorts, sports bra, socks), check necessary accoutrement (watch, phone), perform a sacred set of stretches as I put my shoes on. I shake my limbs out for a moment, take a breath, then launch myself off the concrete and onto the road. My muscles spring back and the shock absorbers of my quads reverberate as I begin to pound pavement.

Some days, when I do this, my mind immediately sends a thousand lights across my cortex. _Ah, yes,_ I think, _I love this!_ I smile as I bounce down the sidewalk.

Many days, though, I settle myself in for the feeling that inevitably hits sometime in the first mile. My muscles begin to ache and loosen up. My feet start feeling sore, saying, "Hey! You keep hitting us! Stop that!" After nearly six years of running, I now know that this feeling will usually go away after three miles, and the run will begin to feel OK.

Three miles can feel like a long time, though, and like lots of runners, I used to distract myself by listening to music. I had a playlist of anything that I could focus on until I got near the end of the run and could think, _Hey, I ran and I barely even remember it!_
